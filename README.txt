It's a program that iterates through MLB 2013 players in an excel .csv file containing their respective offensive statistics and generates relevant statistics. The program in Team_Generator simply creates a .txt file ranking players by offensive stats. The program in Batting does something similar but also has a prompt that runs in the python IDLE terminal. As it turns out stand_bat_comp.py was the rough draft and generator.py is the revised product. Ideally I'd like to add a more robust prompt-style function to generator.py and also create functions for ranking pitchers. The programs are relatively simple in concept and only required sifting through Python documentation to write. One problem was that the python dictreader only output results as string values, which does not lend itself to computing statistics. As a result, I had to explicitly type-cast each stat. The program is easy enough to modify at this point, but the statistics it generates are questionable simply based on my lack of baseball acumen. However, I like to think that the program generates a solid list of players based on accepted modern statistics and gives a competitive advantage compared to no baseball knowledge or an auto-draft.
